# Hello World
## Who am I?
I am Hanif Dwy Putra S, commonly called **Hanif**, **Hans**, **Nif**, **Nip**. Now, I'm seventeen years old (17 years),
I live in Palu, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. I'm a student and work as IT Support Technician (_unpaid_) at
[SMA Negeri 3 Palu](https://sman3palu.sch.id).

## Histories

### Elementary School Part 01 - The first step where I love code.
I've loved technology since the fourth grade of elementary school in 2017.
The first technology I learned was [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), which was v8.x that year.

I didn't have programming skills or any of my family knew about this tech knowledge. I learned it because
I was interested in [Discord](https://discord.com) bots, I really wanted to know how to build and program them.

The first community I learned [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) from was **Garuda** (arguably now abandoned and changed ownership), they taught me how to code from the basics, such as _“how to install Visual Studio Code”, “how to install Node.js”, and “how to fix syntax issues in general”_.

### Elementary School Part 02 - The second step where I really interest in algorithm and logics.

So, in grade five and grade six of elementary school in 2018. I started to get interested in algorithms and programming logic, at this stage I really enjoyed programming logic which helped me with my homework (especially math). And, I was able to create my own website to expose my daily activities and a simple CRUD website using PHP (I created it with _Samsung Tab 3T Lite Galaxy_).

In this year, it was my first time learning [Java](https://java.com) and [Docker](https://docker.com).

### Junior High School - Hello Python and DevOps!

Okkkayyy, in middle school I have so many stories to tell. But, I will say that in this year I learned a lot of
technology stack. Like [Python](https://python.org), [Docker](https://docker.com), [Java](https://java.com), [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), and many moreeee....

So, why does the title of this section say _“Hello Python and DevOps!”_?
Because this year, I joined [Raznar](https://raznar.id) which is the cheapest/affordable and high-performance hosting. You can host anything here, like game hosting, app hosting, or maybe you need a VM server? [Raznar](https://raznar.id) is the best for you.

Okay, enough promotion, lol. At [Raznar](https://raznar.id) I learned many things about DevOps, such as how to manage containers and images in [Docker](https://docker.com), how to handle traffic on proxy servers, setting up CI/CD, load balancing, horizontal scaling, etc...

Well, I also learned web scraping. I like how service providers hide their API services that are being scraped from us,
and we have to analyze or reverse engineer their application to sniff the service URL. Usually, I use [BurpSuite](https://https://portswigger.net/burp), and other Python libraries.

### High School - Hi?
